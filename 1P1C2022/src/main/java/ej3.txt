**Infix Expression:**
5 ^ ( 1 - 1 ) ^ ( 3 / 1 ) * 5

**Conversion Rules Recap:**
- Operands are added directly to the output.
- When an operator is encountered, pop from the stack if the operator at the top has higher precedence (or equal precedence if left-associative; note: '^' is right-associative).
- Push left parentheses '(' onto the stack.
- On encountering a right parenthesis ')', pop until a left parenthesis '(' is found (discard both).

**Step-by-Step Process:**

| Step | Stack State                | Current Token         | Output So Far            |
|------|---------------------       |---------------        |--------------------------|
| 1    | _empty_                    | 5                     | 5                        |
| 2    | ^                          | ^                     | 5                        |
| 3    | ^ (                        | (                     | 5                        |
| 4    | ^ (                        | 1                     | 5 1                      |
| 5    | ^ ( -                      | -                     | 5 1                      |
| 6    | ^ ( -                      | 1                     | 5 1 1                    |
| 7    | ^                          | )  → pop '-' then '(' | 5 1 1 -                  |
| 8    | ^ ^                        | ^                     | 5 1 1 -                  |
| 9    | ^ ^ (                      | (                     | 5 1 1 -                  |
| 10   | ^ ^ (                      | 3                     | 5 1 1 - 3                |
| 11   | ^ ^ ( /                    | /                     | 5 1 1 - 3                |
| 12   | ^ ^ ( /                    | 1                     | 5 1 1 - 3 1              |
| 13   | ^ ^                        | )  → pop '/' then '(' | 5 1 1 - 3 1 /            |
| 14   | _pop until empty; push *_  | *                     | Pop both '^' operators: output becomes "5 1 1 - 3 1 / ^ ^" |
| 15   | *                          | 5                     | 5 1 1 - 3 1 / ^ ^ 5      |
| End  | _empty_ (after popping *)  | -                     | Final Output: 5 1 1 - 3 1 / ^ ^ 5 *  |

**Final Postfix Expression:**
5 1 1 - 3 1 / ^ ^ 5 *

*Note:* In Step 14, while processing '*', we compared '*' with the '^' operators on the stack. Since '^' has higher precedence, both '^' operators were popped (and appended to the output) before '*' was pushed.
